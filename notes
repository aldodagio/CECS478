- caesar cipher (shifting right/left)
- substitution cipher
- code wheels
- book ciphers
- rolling pad ciphers
- germany had enigma machine
- substitution 
- transposition
- hashing is not cryptography
- hashing is not cypto strong
- hashing is one way
- symmetric crypto
- asymmetric crypto (2 keys)
- transport encryption (encrypt the thing that carries message)
- RSA encryption - defacto encryption algo
- ssh demonstrated using telnet
- pgp encryption
09/13/2023:
- TOR Browser video (Russia trying to get rid of TOR)
- Transparency for Tor is key
- open source / free software
- public design documents and specs
- DPI - deep packet inspection
- the TOR protocol looks mostly like TLS but only if you dont look too carefully. 
- russia is trying to get rid of TOR so they can censor their people?
- blocked azure by ip address
- atp couldnt do skype from russia and other apps
- judge in russia said you must unblock tor in russia when a group of russians found their website was illegally blocked according to russian law. basically russian government broke their own law.
- they also challenged google to take tor out of their app store
- what is rt.com?
- bidirectional blocking
- what is snowflake really?
- improve usability of arms race - 'user impact'
- sanctions cause governments to censor more easily
09/18/2023:
- there was a speed bump during first batch of emails - i think prof was sending base64 encoded test
- aws is linux command based
- hashing is not encryption
- base64 encodes text to shorten it - urls and such
- for most part, any linux distro will keep file system fairly consistent
- not common for boot directory to be separate
- look for grub in boot directory
- grub knows where it is located and needs instructions on what to do next
- kernel resides in boot
- kernel is essentially boss of OS
- it is core piece of OS that decides things
- everything else is just processes
- everything in linux is a file
- which is a good thing
- dev folder is a folder of devices
- tty (actually has to do with terminal) - teletype interface (see teleprinter)
- think of it as terminal output
- pts is ports?
- system properties reside in /etc directory
- generally under var is where you can find system logs
- can be used to investigate things
- can see who is connecting as well 
- under va/log
- syslog will tell you the connections establishing
09/20/2023:
- Exam next week wednesday - bring Student ID
- Will be on canvas quizzes
- Allowed 1 page note - front and back
- everything up to next week will be on exam: github, linux, pgp, probably CIA triad, and Russia video (TOR)
- topic for today - customize your linux environment (dot files)
- 'notify' #report the status of background jobs (zshell)
- can customize the history of saved prompts on command line
- command 'date' gives current date and time (-u will give you UTC time - aka system time)
- config files conventionally have .rc 
- vim vs nano
- can have plugins for vim
- Linux uses hierarchy with kernel at the top (root)
- kernel is typically referred to as PI0 (process instance 0)
- forking is duplicating a process
- PID1 (init or systemd) - our process manager in future will kickoff more processes
- PID0 is parent of PID1
- kernel can have many children
- hierarchy creates tree strucutre
- children exit/kill once parent exits/killed
- assume our process manager has child that is login script 
- the login script has children (users who login)
- then user can have children like browser, gui, shell
- children can derive the permissions of their parent (never more, but can be less)
- logging in as root you get root permissions
- sudo can be used for any command to make it an admin run command
Processes:
- 'ps' command to see processes
- sudo ps aux - see ALL processes
- sudo ps aux - grep
- grep is used to find 
09/25/2023:
- Exam will be on wednesday 09/27/2023
- pgp aims to solve the key exchange
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- combination of public and private key 
- in order to encrypt we need to have recipients public key
- the message gets encrypted using senders private key
- the recipient then needs the senders public key to decrypt it 
- that is the beauty of asymmetric encryption
- one sheet of notes front and back
- git will be on the test
10/02/2023:
- sam bent sold illegal goods on the dark web for years
- served prison time
- DEF CON 30
- darknet vendor vs hacker
- hacking culture is much more accessible than learning how to use the darknet
- learning the darknet is more about just hopping on and exploring because it doesnt have any existing guidelines
- there is some real ethical values that go in to the thought process of red team people like sam bent
- there is an aspect of vigalante
- Hugbunter created Dread in response to Reddit banning the darknetmarkets
- drug trafficers may not understand encryption - making themselves vulnerable
- complacency is the enemy of security
- weekly security checks of the system is recomended
- changing pgp key allows you to switch up and take a target off your back
- you may lose your reputation but it is better than going to prison
- emphasizing switching pgp key
- operation dark gold 
- Elk Cloner - boot sector virus that affected the apple 2 computer line
10/11/2023:
- 'saved' game is a frozen game
- have to run 64 bit exe in virtual machine
- we have to find a hidden password? 
- self destruct ship by entering destruct command
- put the credits in the beginning
Brain Virus:
- first known pc virus that affected any ibm hardware
- secondly, the next virus was known as the 'stoned virus' 
- got rid of check on flag and just infected computer nonetheless (floppy disks infected most the time)
- scanned harddrives, disks, and any writable disks and infected them
- "Your computer is now stoned"
- it was pretty much impossible to get rid of
- michaelangelo virus made headlines because it would wipe all files on a machine that was left on on March 6th
Virus vs Worm:
- worm (fast spreader) vs virus (harden)
- POP is post office protocol
- morris worm tried to count the number of nodes on the current internet
- targeted UNIX OS
- bob@mit! (!) is a BANG email address
- he attempted to get login access to these machines by 2 exploits
- email login system and bang email addresses
- basically shutdown internet for a week because it kept replicating itself
- robert morris
10/16/2023:
- enter 'destruct' and it will prompt you to enter password ; and that's how you will know if you have the correct password
Lecture:
- internet went public in approx. 1993
- 1995 - pcs got their first graphical os - windows 95 
- prior to 1995 most pcs ran ms-dos with windows 3.1 - single tasking (one process running at a time)
- windows 95 brought multi taskings OS's 
- oracle-java - jvm
- ms office
- VB script (visual basic)
- macro virus
- iloveyou virus attacked by opening email subject lined ILOVEYOU
- interpreted language run the risk of macro virus
- personal digital assistant - phone (pda)
- sembian os (nokia) - bluetooth 1.0
- bluetooth 1.0 didnt have much security 
- thus enter the cabir worm, initially spread via bluetooth
- unlimited data -original iphone and it also had great web browser
10/18/2023:
- ken thompson turing award winner and wrote the refections on tusting tust
- thomson, brian kerneghan, dennis ritchie worked at bell labs and worked with circuit switches networks and packet switched networks
- UNIX - bsd (berkley standard) and sys v (linux)
- brian and dennis developed C
- unix switches from mainframes to smaller computing
- ken added backdoor to c compiler to login to any unix system
- source code -> compiler -> lexical analysis -> parsing -> linking/asm -> optimization -> binary
- do 'bug' - C bug by ken thompson
- bug was placed after source code to get directly to binary
10/23/2023:
Sword/Wand:
- edit label in emulator to comment assembly code
- if then is equivalent to compare branch
- compare is a subtration operation and stores the results in flags
- Zero, Carry, Negative flags
- beq - branch if equal 
- bne - branch if not equal
- bcs - branch if carry set
- bcc - branch if carry clear
- zero flag is set if A - B = 0 AKA when they are equal
- if the diagnol sprite was for a slashing movement, then why was the wand the one in question? and not the sword
- eliminated wind up from sword to attack enemies immediately and faster strikes
- wind up was by nintendo design
- setting breakpoints
- copy, paste, tweak, repeat
Item drops:
- are item drops random? or predictable?
- drop turn is skipped in certain scenarios (when enemy gets split from sword not being strong enough)
- and operation and xor operation used to calculate randomness, but was predictable
11/1/2023:
- project malware - lifo/fifo stack/queue and little endian and big endian
- rpn = reverse polish notation
- no op or jump to get passed password
- ransomware could fall as dos attach
- confidentiality, integrity, availability
- project chanology
- 4chan (anonymous chat)
- program - low orbit ion cannon - diagnostic tool that can be used as dos attack using networking protocols
- ipx/spx - nobel
- tcp/ip - open protocol that operates the internet
- tcp packet - error collection (malformed, incorrect, etc)
- error collection allows you to get data that mightbe been missed initially
- ping flood takes up cpu resource - obviously traceable tho
- ping of death - 
- http, email protocol, etc use tcp
- watching videos, getting video content uses UDP 
- because udp streams as gets data, udp flood attacks are quite effective
- tcp three way handshake for some validity of connection state
- syn flood takes up pyshical connection states with dead services
