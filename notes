- phone phreak - capn crunch had a whistle from cereal box that made 2600 hz
- steve's - beige box - steve wazniyak and steve jobs - allowed people to make free phone calls to pay for college

1. Create new
2. Name your VM
3. Set type to Linux
4. Select Ubuntu (64-bit)
5. If you have 16 GB then 2 GB

- guest additions installations and restart after
- shared clipboard and drag and drop - bidirectional

error:
error: cannot allocate kernel buffer.
error: you need to load the kernel first.


install linux to harddisk
software sources - "mirrors" - test which one is faster

by tuesday, fill out google docsv
9/6/2023:
- caesar cipher (shifting right/left)
- substitution cipher
- code wheels
- book ciphers
- rolling pad ciphers
- germany had enigma machine
- substitution 
- transposition
- hashing is not cryptography
- hashing is not cypto strong
- hashing is one way
- symmetric crypto
- asymmetric crypto (2 keys)
- transport encryption (encrypt the thing that carries message)
- RSA encryption - defacto encryption algo
- ssh demonstrated using telnet
- pgp encryption
09/13/2023:
- TOR Browser video (Russia trying to get rid of TOR)
- Transparency for Tor is key
- open source / free software
- public design documents and specs
- DPI - deep packet inspection
- the TOR protocol looks mostly like TLS but only if you dont look too carefully. 
- russia is trying to get rid of TOR so they can censor their people?
- blocked azure by ip address
- atp couldnt do skype from russia and other apps
- judge in russia said you must unblock tor in russia when a group of russians found their website was illegally blocked according to russian law. basically russian government broke their own law.
- they also challenged google to take tor out of their app store
- what is rt.com?
- bidirectional blocking
- what is snowflake really?
- improve usability of arms race - 'user impact'
- sanctions cause governments to censor more easily
09/18/2023:
- there was a speed bump during first batch of emails - i think prof was sending base64 encoded test
- aws is linux command based
- hashing is not encryption
- base64 encodes text to shorten it - urls and such
- for most part, any linux distro will keep file system fairly consistent
- not common for boot directory to be separate
- look for grub in boot directory
- grub knows where it is located and needs instructions on what to do next
- kernel resides in boot
- kernel is essentially boss of OS
- it is core piece of OS that decides things
- everything else is just processes
- everything in linux is a file
- which is a good thing
- dev folder is a folder of devices
- tty (actually has to do with terminal) - teletype interface (see teleprinter)
- think of it as terminal output
- pts is ports?
- system properties reside in /etc directory
- generally under var is where you can find system logs
- can be used to investigate things
- can see who is connecting as well 
- under va/log
- syslog will tell you the connections establishing
09/20/2023:
- Exam next week wednesday - bring Student ID
- Will be on canvas quizzes
- Allowed 1 page note - front and back
- everything up to next week will be on exam: github, linux, pgp, probably CIA triad, and Russia video (TOR)
- topic for today - customize your linux environment (dot files)
- 'notify' #report the status of background jobs (zshell)
- can customize the history of saved prompts on command line
- command 'date' gives current date and time (-u will give you UTC time - aka system time)
- config files conventionally have .rc 
- vim vs nano
- can have plugins for vim
- Linux uses hierarchy with kernel at the top (root)
- kernel is typically referred to as PI0 (process instance 0)
- forking is duplicating a process
- PID1 (init or systemd) - our process manager in future will kickoff more processes
- PID0 is parent of PID1
- kernel can have many children
- hierarchy creates tree strucutre
- children exit/kill once parent exits/killed
- assume our process manager has child that is login script 
- the login script has children (users who login)
- then user can have children like browser, gui, shell
- children can derive the permissions of their parent (never more, but can be less)
- logging in as root you get root permissions
- sudo can be used for any command to make it an admin run command
Processes:
- 'ps' command to see processes
- sudo ps aux - see ALL processes
- sudo ps aux - grep
- grep is used to find 
09/25/2023:
- Exam will be on wednesday 09/27/2023
- pgp aims to solve the key exchange
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- combination of public and private key 
- in order to encrypt we need to have recipients public key
- the message gets encrypted using senders private key
- the recipient then needs the senders public key to decrypt it 
- that is the beauty of asymmetric encryption
- one sheet of notes front and back
- git will be on the test
10/02/2023:
- sam bent sold illegal goods on the dark web for years
- served prison time
- DEF CON 30
- darknet vendor vs hacker
- hacking culture is much more accessible than learning how to use the darknet
- learning the darknet is more about just hopping on and exploring because it doesnt have any existing guidelines
- there is some real ethical values that go in to the thought process of red team people like sam bent
- there is an aspect of vigalante
- Hugbunter created Dread in response to Reddit banning the darknetmarkets
- drug trafficers may not understand encryption - making themselves vulnerable
- complacency is the enemy of security
- weekly security checks of the system is recomended
- changing pgp key allows you to switch up and take a target off your back
- you may lose your reputation but it is better than going to prison
- emphasizing switching pgp key
- operation dark gold
-
